This program obtains 1D arrays as its numerical input and combines them with categorical input which is nucleotide bases of RNA. Then, 1D-CNN accepts mixed input to produce a single numerical outcome. One example of these type of models are shown below. As it looks like a graph with 2 branches, one brach (longer) is associated with numerical input and the other brach (little) is designed for accepting categorical variables.
